description: This fast-paced detective story, written by Major Arthur Griffiths involves
  a murder on a flying express train, a wily Italian, a charming woman caught in the
  meshes of circumstantial evidence, a chivalrous Englishman, and a police force with
  a keen nose for the wrong clue - all the ingredients of a rip-roaring mystery from
  the age of steam. This version has been specially formatted for today's e-readers
  by Andrews UK.
